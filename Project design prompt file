Enhanced Project Prompt: Global Trending News Aggregation & Intelligence System
📌 Project Title

Design and Implement a Real-Time Global Trending News Aggregation Platform Using Open RSS Feeds

🎯 Project Objective

To design, develop, and deploy a high-performance, SEO-optimized, and user-centric web platform that automatically identifies, aggregates, and displays globally trending news and media content by analyzing open RSS feeds from verified international publishers, technology platforms, and research organizations.

The platform will prioritize relevance, freshness, and credibility while maintaining a lightweight, scalable, and open-source architecture suitable for static hosting environments.

🧩 Problem Statement

Digital news content is fragmented across thousands of platforms, making it difficult for users to identify high-impact, trending, and trustworthy stories in real time.

Most aggregators display chronological feeds without context, leading to information overload and reduced engagement.

This project addresses the need for a trend-focused intelligence layer that filters and surfaces only the most relevant global news.

🛠️ Project Scope

The system will:

Collect RSS feeds from globally recognized publishers

Perform real-time trend detection and relevance scoring

Filter duplicate and low-impact stories

Rank content based on popularity and velocity

Categorize trends by domain and geography

Display prioritized trending news in a responsive interface

The solution will remain fully open-source and cost-free.

3️⃣ Trend Detection Methodology

The platform will determine trending content using:

Primary Signals

Multi-source coverage frequency

Publication velocity

Time-weighted relevance

Keyword momentum

Topic clustering

Secondary Signals

Publisher authority score

Historical engagement trends

Geographic spread

Scoring Model (Example)
Trend Score = (Source_Count × 0.3) +
              (Recency × 0.25) +
              (Keyword_Volume × 0.2) +
              (Authority × 0.15) +
              (Engagement × 0.1)
