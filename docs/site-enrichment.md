# Site Enrichment Log

Last updated: 2026-02-25

Purpose: single source of truth for Snapfacts site enhancements. This file tracks what is already shipped and what is planned next.

## 1) Implemented Enhancements (Shipped)

| ID | Area | Enhancement | Outcome | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ENR-001 | Platform setup | Migrated working repo to `AIinc` and aligned GitHub Pages deployment with `snapfacts.in` | Stable production deployment path using existing stack | Done |
| ENR-002 | Data pipeline | Introduced RSS ingestion script (`scripts/fetch_feeds.py`) and source config (`config/sources.json`) | Automated feed collection and normalized trend payload (`data/trends.json`) | Done |
| ENR-003 | Ranking model | Added trend scoring formula (source, recency, keywords, authority, engagement) | Prioritized high-signal stories instead of chronological noise | Done |
| ENR-004 | CI/CD automation | Added scheduled GitHub Actions refresh workflow with commit-on-change behavior | Feeds refresh on schedule without manual intervention | Done |
| ENR-005 | Failure handling | Added workflow failure notification support (Slack webhook path) | Faster incident visibility for failed refresh jobs | Done |
| ENR-006 | Telemetry | Added JSON badge endpoints (`last-refresh`, `feeds-polled`) | Health/freshness visibility in README and ops checks | Done |
| ENR-007 | 24-hour freshness filter | Restricted feed output to last 24 hours in production runs | Cleaner homepage with current stories only | Done |
| ENR-008 | Header/footer branding pass | Updated Snapfacts naming and removed outdated header/footer elements | Improved brand consistency | Done |
| ENR-009 | Layout v3 foundation | Rebuilt homepage structure to editorial grid style (lead card + supporting columns + rail) | Better scanability and content hierarchy | Done |
| ENR-010 | Tech-only feed focus | Reduced source pool to core technology/AI publishers | Higher topical relevance for target audience | Done |
| ENR-011 | Secondary column restyle | Aligned middle column cards with right rail dark theme | Visual consistency across card sections | Done |
| ENR-012 | Headline-first cards | Made 3rd/4th column cards headline-link focused with image placement under headlines | Stronger click intent and simpler reading pattern | Done |
| ENR-013 | Real feed image capture | Enhanced ingestion to extract image URLs from RSS/Atom fields when present | More authentic visual cards from source content | Done |
| ENR-014 | Image fallback logic | Added frontend fallback to generate a card image when RSS image is missing | No empty-image cards; stable visual quality | Done |
| ENR-015 | Context-aware image generation | Replaced plain blue fallback with context-sensitive generated thumbnails using headline/content signals | Better visual variety and article-context relevance | Done |

## 2) Current Source Baseline

Active technology-oriented feeds currently configured in `config/sources.json`:

1. The Verge
2. TechCrunch
3. MIT Technology Review
4. Wired
5. Google AI Blog
6. Microsoft Research Blog
7. OpenAI Blog
8. NVIDIA Blog

## 3) Existing Architecture Snapshot (Preserved)

| Layer | Current Implementation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | `index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/app.js` | Static, lightweight, GitHub Pages compatible |
| Ingestion | `scripts/fetch_feeds.py` | Dedup + scoring + image extraction |
| Data | `data/trends.json` + badges | Generated by workflow |
| Automation | GitHub Actions schedule | Refresh and publish pipeline |
| Delivery | GitHub Pages + Cloudflare DNS/SSL | Current production route |

## 4) Backlog (Future Enhancements)

| ID | Proposed Enhancement | Why | Priority | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ENR-N01 | Add explicit `image_source` metadata in trends payload | Easier QA for image origin (feed vs generated) | High | Planned |
